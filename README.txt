In order to install and play Ocamon, you must make sure to follow these next
steps. These will help you get an appropriate installation of Camlimages going
for use in Ocamon!

First, BEFORE installing Ocamon, make sure you install these 2 supplementary
libraries that it requires (to use JPGs and PNGs effectively). (If you already
have Camlimages installed, you may need to remove and reinstall after installing
the two supplements, or install on a newly built virtual machine as specified
in the class.)

To install these, just download the repositories and follow the installation
instructions. Make sure to use <sudo make install> when the instructions
suggest to use <make install>.

   - The first library is LIBPNG for use with PNGs and it can be downloaded at
      the following link : https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/ .

   - The second library is LIBJPEG for use with JPGs and it can be downloaded at
      the following link : http://www.ijg.org/ .

Second, after installing these libraries simply use <opam install camlimages>
and press Y to the prompts to install. (Or re-install camlimages if it was
already installed.)

Finally, simply enter <make play> into the console terminal while in the ocamon
directory to begin the game! Enjoy your adventure in the wonderful world of
Ocamon!
